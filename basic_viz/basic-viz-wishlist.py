# this is my basic data viz wishlist
# only for stats about the data, not the more complex stuff

# how many languages were scraped?
# how many of those were consonants successfully extracted?

# what consonants are present?
# wordcloud of consonants potentially

# lang with most consonants?
# least consonants?

# histogram of consonants per lang

# most common and least common consonants?

# for each lang, what is its most emblematic set of
# consonants? like a screwy tf-idf
